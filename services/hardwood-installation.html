    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I install solid or engineered hardwood in Spokane?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For most Spokane homes, engineered hardwood is the recommended choice. The Inland Northwest's dramatic humidity swings — from extremely dry winters (below 25% RH indoors) to moderate summers — cause solid hardwood to expand and contract significantly, leading to gaps, cupping, and finish stress. Engineered hardwood's cross-ply construction resists these movements while looking identical to solid. Solid hardwood works well in rooms with controlled humidity but is not recommended over concrete subfloors."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much does hardwood floor installation cost in Spokane?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hardwood floor installation in Spokane typically costs $6–$12 per sq ft installed (materials + labor). Engineered hardwood material runs $3–$8/sq ft. Solid hardwood material runs $4–$10/sq ft. Labor is $3–$5/sq ft. Subfloor preparation, removal of existing flooring, and transitions are additional costs."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does hardwood need to acclimate before installation in Spokane?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Hardwood should acclimate in your Spokane home for 5–10 days before installation. This is especially critical in the Pacific Northwest where seasonal humidity differences between supply warehouses and your home can be significant. The wood needs to reach equilibrium with your home's temperature and humidity before it's fastened down. Rushing this step is the single biggest cause of post-installation problems."}}]}

                <h2>Choosing Hardwood for Spokane's Climate</h2>
                <p>Spokane sits in a unique climate zone — the Inland Northwest is drier than the rainy western side of Washington, with cold winters that drop indoor humidity to 20–25% and moderate summers that can push humidity to 40–50%. This seasonal swing means the wrong hardwood choice or installation approach can lead to gapping, cupping, and premature finish failure within the first year.</p>
                <p>At Selkirk Hardwood, every installation recommendation starts with your specific home's conditions: subfloor type, heating system, humidity patterns, and lifestyle. We don't sell one-size-fits-all solutions — we engineer each installation for long-term success in the Inland Northwest.</p>

                <h2>Engineered vs. Solid Hardwood for Spokane</h2>
                <p><strong>Engineered hardwood</strong> is our most recommended product for Spokane installations. Its cross-ply plywood core construction resists the expansion and contraction caused by Spokane's humidity swings far better than solid wood. It's the only appropriate choice for installation over concrete subfloors (common in Spokane basements and slab-on-grade homes). Modern engineered hardwood looks identical to solid and can be refinished 1–3 times.</p>
                <p><strong>Solid hardwood</strong> is a beautiful, long-lasting option for rooms with consistent climate control. It can be sanded and refinished many times over a 100+ year lifespan. However, it requires careful humidity management in Spokane — a whole-house humidifier is strongly recommended for homes with solid hardwood to maintain 35–45% indoor RH year-round.</p>

                <h2>Popular Species for Spokane Homes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>White Oak:</strong> The most popular choice — beautiful grain, excellent hardness (Janka 1360), takes stain beautifully. Perfect for both modern and traditional Spokane homes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Red Oak:</strong> Classic warmth with slightly more pronounced grain. Excellent value for larger installations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hickory:</strong> The hardest common domestic species (Janka 1820). Dramatic grain variation suits rustic and craftsman-style Spokane homes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard Maple:</strong> Light, clean, modern look with excellent hardness (1450). Great for contemporary Pacific Northwest interiors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Douglas Fir:</strong> A local Pacific Northwest softwood with warm character — beautiful in historic Spokane homes but softer and best for lower-traffic areas.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Proper Subfloor Preparation</h2>
                <p>The foundation of every great hardwood installation is the subfloor. We require flatness within 3/16" over a 10-foot span and address all moisture issues before wood is delivered. In Spokane, where many homes have older plywood subfloors or basement concrete, moisture testing is essential before installation.</p>

                <h2>Hardwood Installation Pricing in Spokane</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Engineered hardwood installed:</strong> $6–$10 per sq ft (material + labor)</li>
                    <li><strong>Solid hardwood installed:</strong> $7–$12 per sq ft (material + labor)</li>
                    <li><strong>Subfloor prep:</strong> $1–$3 per sq ft additional if needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Existing floor removal:</strong> $1–$2 per sq ft additional</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Should I install solid or engineered hardwood in Spokane?</h3>
                <p>Engineered hardwood is recommended for most Spokane homes due to the Inland Northwest's dramatic humidity swings.

                <h3>How much does hardwood floor installation cost in Spokane?</h3>
                <p>Installation costs $6–$12 per sq ft installed (materials + labor). Engineered material runs $3–$8/sq ft; solid $4–$10/sq ft. Labor is $3–$5/sq ft. Subfloor prep and existing floor removal are additional.</p>

                <h3>How long does hardwood need to acclimate before installation in Spokane?</h3>
                <p>5–10 days in your home. This is critical in the Pacific Northwest where humidity differences between warehouses and your home can be significant. Rushing acclimation is the single biggest cause of post-installation problems.</p>
