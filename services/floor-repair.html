    {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Can water-damaged hardwood floors be repaired in Spokane?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It depends on the extent of damage. Lightly cupped boards from minor water exposure can often be dried, sanded flat, and refinished. Boards with permanent structural damage — buckling, severe warping, or black mold staining from prolonged water contact — need to be replaced. In Spokane, water damage to hardwood is common from snowmelt intrusion, frozen pipe bursts, and appliance leaks. We assess the full extent of damage before recommending repair vs. replacement for each affected area."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I fix gaps in hardwood floors in Spokane's dry climate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Gaps in Spokane hardwood are usually seasonal — boards contract in winter's dry air and expand back in summer. If gaps close during humid months, they're considered normal and should not be permanently filled (rigid filler will crack or get pushed out when boards expand). For year-round gaps that never close, we use flexible, stainable wood filler that moves with the wood. Running a humidifier to keep indoor humidity at 35–45% significantly reduces winter gapping."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can individual hardwood boards be replaced without replacing the whole floor?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes — skilled board replacement is one of our most common services. Damaged boards are carefully removed without disturbing adjacent boards. New matching material is cut, fitted, and installed. The repaired area is sanded and finished to blend with the surrounding floor. The result is typically unnoticeable from normal viewing distance."}}]}

                <h2>Water Damage Is the #1 Hardwood Repair Issue in Spokane</h2>
                <p>The Pacific Northwest's moisture-heavy environment means water damage to hardwood floors is far more common in Spokane than most other regions. Spring snowmelt saturates the ground and can enter basements and lower levels through foundation cracks. Frozen pipes during Spokane's subzero winter stretches burst and flood living spaces. Roof ice dams create slow leaks that damage upper-floor hardwood. And the region's frequent rain events can overwhelm window seals and exterior drainage.</p>
                <p>The good news: most water-damaged hardwood can be repaired rather than replaced. The key is acting quickly — wood that sits wet for more than 48 hours is far more likely to require full board replacement than wood that's dried professionally within hours. If you have active water on your hardwood floors, call us immediately.</p>

                <h2>Hardwood Repair Services We Offer</h2>

                <h3>Water Damage Restoration</h3>
                <p>When caught early, cupped and buckled boards can be restored through professional drying, sanding, and refinishing. We use industrial dehumidifiers and moisture meters to dry the subfloor and flooring completely before any repair work begins. Boards with permanent structural damage — severe warping, delamination, or mold — are replaced with matching material.</p>

                <h3>Board Replacement</h3>
                <p>Damaged boards from water, impact, pet urine, or structural failure are carefully removed and replaced with matching species, profile, and width. We source matching material, cut and fit replacements, then sand and finish the repair area to blend with the surrounding floor. Our craftsmen make repairs that are nearly invisible from normal viewing distance.</p>

                <h3>Gap Filling &amp; Seasonal Gaps</h3>
                <p>Spokane's dry winters cause hardwood to contract, opening gaps between boards that close again in summer. For truly seasonal gaps, we recommend maintaining 35–45% indoor humidity with a humidifier rather than filling gaps that will close on their own. For permanent year-round gaps, we use flexible, stainable wood filler that moves with the wood. Severely gapped floors may require re-laying or weave-in repairs.</p>

                <h3>Squeaky Floor Repair</h3>
                <p>Squeaks in Spokane homes are typically caused by seasonal wood movement — boards rub against each other or the subfloor as they expand and contract. We diagnose the exact cause and apply the right fix: face-nailing, subfloor fastening, glue injection, or bridging from below.</p>

                <h3>Pet Damage Repair</h3>
                <p>Surface scratches from pet nails are removed during standard refinishing. Urine that has penetrated into raw wood creates permanent stains that require board replacement. We'll assess your damage and tell you exactly what's possible.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Can water-damaged hardwood floors be repaired in Spokane?</h3>
                <p>Often yes. Lightly cupped boards from minor water exposure can be dried, sanded flat, and refinished. Severely warped, buckled, or mold-stained boards need replacement. Speed matters — call immediately when water contacts your hardwood.</p>

                <h3>How do I fix gaps in hardwood floors in Spokane's dry climate?</h3>
                <p>If gaps close during humid months, they're seasonal and shouldn't be permanently filled. Running a humidifier to 35–45% indoor RH significantly reduces winter gapping. Year-round gaps can be filled with flexible, stainable wood filler.</p>

                <h3>Can individual hardwood boards be replaced without replacing the whole floor?</h3>
                <p>Yes — we carefully remove damaged boards, fit new matching material, and sand and finish the repair to blend with the surrounding floor. The result is typically unnoticeable from standing height.</p>
