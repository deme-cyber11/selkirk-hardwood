Winter indoor humidity drops to 15–25% when furnaces run constantly, causing wood contraction and gap formation. Summer brings heat and UV exposure.

Refinish if: floors have enough thickness (we check with a gauge), damage is cosmetic, or you want a color change. Replace if: boards are too thin for sanding, structural damage exists, or you want a completely different wood species. We'll give you an honest assessment during our free estimate."}

We work room by room when possible. You'll need to avoid walking on freshly finished floors for 24 hours and wait 72 hours before replacing furniture. If the entire house is being done at once, staying with friends or family for 3–4 days makes the process faster for everyone."}

High-traffic homes with kids and pets may need it every 5–7 years. Low-traffic rooms can go 15+ years. Signs it's time: visible scratches through the finish to bare wood, dull gray areas where finish has worn away, or water no longer beads on the surface. A maintenance coat (screen and recoat) every 3–5 years can extend the time between full refinishes."}
