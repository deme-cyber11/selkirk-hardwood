                    <h1>How Long Does Hardwood Floor Refinishing Take?</h1>
                    <p style="color:#666;margin-bottom:2rem;"><time datetime="2026-02-21">February 21, 2026</time> · 5 min read</p>

                    <p>One of the most common questions we hear at Selkirk Hardwood is: "How long will I be out of my rooms?" The short answer is <strong>3 to 5 days</strong> for a typical refinishing project — but the full picture depends on several factors. Here's a detailed breakdown so you can plan accordingly.</p>

                    <h2>Day-by-Day Timeline: Standard Refinishing</h2>
                    <p>Here's what a typical whole-house refinishing project (800–1,500 sq ft) looks like:</p>

                    <h3>Day 1: Preparation &amp; Rough Sanding</h3>
                    <p>The crew arrives, sets up dustless sanding equipment, protects doorways with plastic sheeting, and removes any remaining furniture or obstacles. Rough sanding (36–60 grit) removes the old finish and any surface damage. This is the loudest, dustiest part — though with dustless systems, 99% of the dust is captured at the source.</p>
                    <p>For floors with multiple layers of old finish, heavy pet stains, or paint splatter, this stage may extend into the early part of Day 2.</p>

                    <h3>Day 2: Fine Sanding &amp; Stain Application</h3>
                    <p>The crew progresses through finer grits (80, 100, then 120) to create a smooth, uniform surface. After vacuuming and tack-clothing the floor, stain is applied if you've chosen a color change. The stain needs 6–12 hours to dry before the first coat of finish.</p>
                    <p>If you're going with a natural (no stain) finish, the first coat of polyurethane can go down on the afternoon of Day 2.</p>

                    <h3>Day 3: First Coat of Finish</h3>
                    <p>The first coat of water-based polyurethane is applied. Water-based finishes like Bona Traffic HD dry to the touch in 2–3 hours but need overnight curing before the next coat. No foot traffic is allowed during this period.</p>

                    <h3>Day 4: Light Abrasion &amp; Second Coat</h3>
                    <p>A light screen (abrasion) between coats ensures proper adhesion. The second coat goes down and dries overnight. For projects requiring three coats (our standard), this same process repeats on Day 5.</p>

                    <h3>Day 5: Final Coat &amp; Light Furniture Return</h3>
                    <p>The final coat is applied. After 24 hours, you can walk on the floors in socks. Light furniture (no felt pads yet) can return in 48 hours. Full cure takes 7–14 days, during which you should avoid area rugs, heavy furniture, and wet mopping.</p>

                    <h2>Factors That Affect Timeline</h2>

                    <h3>Project Size</h3>
                    <p>A single room (150–300 sq ft) might take just 2–3 days, while a full 2,500+ sq ft home could need 5–7 days. Larger homes can sometimes be done in zones, allowing you to use parts of your home while other areas cure.</p>

                    <h3>Floor Condition</h3>
                    <p>Floors with deep scratches, <a href="pet-damage-hardwood-floor-repair-spokane.html">pet damage</a>, or water stains need extra sanding passes. Board replacement adds half a day to a full day. If your floors have been painted, waxed, or covered in adhesive from old tile or carpet, expect additional prep time.</p>

                    <h3>Stain vs. Natural</h3>
                    <p>Adding stain adds 1 full day to the timeline because stain needs adequate drying time before finish coats can begin. Custom color matching (when you want to match new wood to existing floors) may require a test area and additional drying time.</p>

                    <h3>Number of Finish Coats</h3>
                    <p>We recommend 3 coats for high-traffic areas and 2 coats for bedrooms and low-traffic spaces. Each coat adds roughly half a day to the schedule.</p>

                    <h3>Humidity &amp; Temperature</h3>
                    <p>Spokane's dry winters are actually ideal for refinishing — low humidity means faster dry times. Summer projects may take slightly longer if humidity is high. We monitor conditions carefully and adjust ventilation to ensure optimal curing.</p>

                    <h3>Finish Type</h3>
                    <p>Water-based finishes dry in 2–3 hours between coats. Oil-based polyurethane needs 8–24 hours between coats and can add 2–3 days to the project. This is one of many reasons we prefer water-based systems.</p>

                    <h2>Can I Stay in My Home?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, in most cases. With dustless sanding and water-based finishes, there's minimal odor and no harmful fumes. You'll need to avoid the work area and keep pets away from wet finish, but you can sleep in bedrooms and use bathrooms that aren't being refinished. For whole-house projects, some homeowners prefer to stay elsewhere for 2–3 nights during the finishing phase.</p>

                    <h2>How to Speed Up the Process</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear the rooms before we arrive</strong> — furniture moving adds time and cost</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose a natural finish</strong> — skipping stain saves a full day</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedule in winter</strong> — faster drying, plus easier scheduling means we can often start sooner</li>
                        <li><strong>Remove carpet and tack strips yourself</strong> — save half a day of prep</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose water-based finish</strong> — dries 4× faster than oil-based</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>When Will My Floors Be Fully Cured?</h2>
                    <p>There's a difference between "dry" and "cured." Your floors will be dry enough to walk on in socks within 24 hours of the final coat. But full chemical cure takes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>24 hours:</strong> Light foot traffic (socks only)</li>
                        <li><strong>48 hours:</strong> Normal foot traffic, light furniture</li>
                        <li><strong>7 days:</strong> Area rugs, heavy furniture with felt pads</li>
                        <li><strong>14 days:</strong> Full cure — maximum hardness and scratch resistance</li>
                    </ul>
