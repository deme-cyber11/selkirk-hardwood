                <h1>Hardwood Floor Refinishing in North Spokane</h1>
                <p style="font-size:1.15rem;color:#555;margin-bottom:2rem;">Expert hardwood refinishing for North Spokane's established neighborhoods and family homes. NWFA certified, dustless sanding, 3-year warranty.</p>

                <h2>North Spokane's Hardwood Floor Restoration Experts</h2>
                <p>North Spokane — from the Five Mile Prairie's custom homes to Indian Trail's family neighborhoods to Shadle-Garland's mid-century classics — represents the heart of Spokane's residential character. These established neighborhoods are filled with homes built from the 1940s through the 1980s, many featuring solid hardwood floors that have stood the test of time but need professional restoration to look their best again.</p>

                <p>At Selkirk Hardwood, we've worked extensively throughout the North Side, refinishing floors in Five Mile Prairie custom homes, restoring hidden hardwood under carpet in Shadle-area ranchers, and breathing new life into the oak and fir floors of Whitworth-area colonials. We know the North Side's housing stock — the thick old-growth fir planks in 1940s homes, the red oak strips in 1960s split-levels, and the carpet-covered hardwood waiting to be rediscovered in countless 1970s ranchers.</p>
