                <h1>Hardwood Floor Refinishing in Browne's Addition</h1>
                <p style="font-size:1.15rem;color:#555;margin-bottom:2rem;">Specialist restoration for Browne's Addition's historic Victorian and Craftsman hardwood floors. NWFA certified, EPA Lead-Safe certified, 3-year warranty.</p>

                <h2>Spokane's Historic District Deserves Expert Floor Care</h2>
                <p>Browne's Addition is Spokane's oldest and most architecturally significant residential neighborhood. Established in the 1880s by pioneer J.J. Browne, this tree-lined district west of downtown is home to magnificent Victorian mansions, elegant Queen Anne homes, stately Craftsman bungalows, and beautifully preserved Tudor revivals. The neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places — and the hardwood floors inside these homes are as historically significant as the facades.</p>

                <p>At Selkirk Hardwood, we treat Browne's Addition floors with the reverence they deserve. We've restored old-growth fir floors in 1890s Victorians on Pacific Avenue, refinished intricate parquet patterns in grand Cannon Hill-adjacent homes, and brought new life to the maple and oak strip flooring found in the neighborhood's iconic Craftsman bungalows. Our EPA Lead-Safe certification is essential here — nearly every Browne's Addition home predates 1978.</p>
