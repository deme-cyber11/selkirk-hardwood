                <h1>Hardwood Floor Refinishing in Spokane Valley</h1>
                <p style="font-size:1.15rem;color:#555;margin-bottom:2rem;">Professional hardwood refinishing for Spokane Valley's suburban homes and growing communities. NWFA certified, dustless sanding, 3-year warranty.</p>

                <h2>Spokane Valley's Trusted Hardwood Floor Team</h2>
                <p>Spokane Valley is the Inland Northwest's fastest-growing community, stretching from Millwood to Otis Orchards along the Spokane River corridor. With a mix of established 1970s–1990s ranch homes and newer construction near the Spokane Valley Mall, the Valley's housing stock features some of the most common hardwood flooring challenges we see — worn builder-grade oak, outdated honey-toned finishes, and floors that need a modern refresh to match today's open-concept living.</p>

                <p>At Selkirk Hardwood, we've refinished hundreds of floors across Spokane Valley neighborhoods including Millwood, Opportunity, Greenacres, Veradale, and the University City area. We understand Valley homes — the larger floor plans that benefit from consistent stain color, the open layouts where kitchen and living room floors need to flow seamlessly, and the newer engineered hardwood that requires specialized sanding techniques.</p>
